# Modules directory

## Helpers

Pure functions only. Be strict with this rule. No side effects.

Export module functions.

## Services

Facades request and data fetching into the terminology of the application.

Export module functions.

## Models

Where are they? Well I don't really find the need to use them in my current work.

If I did have models, I would keep them in this modules folder.
